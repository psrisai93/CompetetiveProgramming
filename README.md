Competitive Programming Patterns
Welcome to the Competitive Programming Patterns repository! This repository aims to assist individuals in recognizing and understanding the various patterns that frequently appear in competitive programming problems. By identifying these patterns, we can develop a strategic approach to solving problems more efficiently.

Purpose
The primary goal of this repository is to help you:

Identify Patterns: Understand the common patterns that underlie different competitive programming problems.
Strategize Solutions: Develop a mental framework or mind map to approach problems systematically.
Enhance Problem-Solving Skills: Improve your ability to think in patterns and apply these patterns to new problems.
Getting Started
To get the most out of this repository:

Explore the Patterns: Browse through the documented patterns and familiarize yourself with their characteristics and applications.
Practice Problems: Use the provided examples to practice recognizing and applying these patterns.
Mind Mapping: Create your own mental maps or diagrams to visualize how different patterns can be applied to various problems.
Contributing
We welcome contributions from the community! If you have identified a new pattern or have improvements to existing ones, please feel free to submit a pull request. Together, we can build a comprehensive resource for competitive programming enthusiasts.
